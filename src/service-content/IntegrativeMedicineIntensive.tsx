      <p>
        Are you ready to go beyond symptom management and finally understand what’s truly driving your health challenges? The
        Integrative Medicine Intensive (IMI) is a focused, 90-day partnership with Dr. Dodge that combines the rigor of medical
        training with the depth of functional medicine. This personalized journey uncovers the root causes of chronic symptoms,
        empowers you with a long-term wellness plan, and supports sustainable improvements in your health and quality of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Aletheia Integrative, patients repeatedly share that they feel heard, supported, and genuinely cared for. One patient says,
        “Dr. Dodge and the Aletheia family are always there to assist on my health journey,” and another notes, “Amazing experience for
        my first appointment — Dr. Dodge helped me in ways many other doctors have not.” Others highlight that the team “truly listens
        to what you are going through and works together with you to find solutions that fit your life.”
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re frustrated by temporary fixes, multiple referrals, or feeling stuck in the same health patterns, the IMI is designed
        for motivated patients who want real answers, clarity, and a roadmap toward lasting wellness.

        A 90-day deep-dive designed to uncover the root causes of your health concerns and build a sustainable foundation for lifelong
        wellness.
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold">What Is the Integrative Medicine Intensive?</p>
      <p>
        The Integrative Medicine Intensive (IMI) is a focused, three-month program that blends conventional medical expertise with the
        depth of functional medicine investigation. Rather than managing symptoms, we work together to understand why they’re happening
        — and build a personalized plan for lasting healing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This intensive approach is ideal for individuals who have tried various treatments without finding lasting answers, and who are
        ready to take a more comprehensive, guided look at their health.
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold">Who It’s For</p>
