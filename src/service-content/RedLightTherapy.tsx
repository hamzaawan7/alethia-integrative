        Red Light Therapy is a gentle, noninvasive treatment that uses <strong>low‑level wavelengths of red and near‑infrared
        light</strong> to stimulate healing at the cellular level. It’s a powerful tool in both <strong>functional medicine and
        aesthetic care</strong>, known for its ability to reduce inflammation, promote tissue repair, and improve skin health
        without pain or downtime.
