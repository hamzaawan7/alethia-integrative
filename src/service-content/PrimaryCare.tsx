      <p>
        Routine primary care checkups are one of the most powerful ways to preserve your health, prevent illness, and address
        symptoms at their root. At Aletheia Integrative in Lincoln, Nebraska, Jaime K. Dodge, MD, and our team of integrative and
        direct primary care providers go beyond the conventional model to deliver care that’s proactive, personalized, and deeply
        aligned with your body’s natural ability to heal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our approach combines the best of traditional medicine with functional medicine diagnostics, looking at the full picture of
        your health—including lab work, physical exams, lifestyle factors, and underlying imbalances. Whether you’re coming in for a
        checkup, chronic condition support, or preventive care, each visit is designed to uncover the “why” behind your symptoms—not
        just treat the surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also incorporate holistic methods where appropriate, including nutritional support, targeted supplementation, and therapies
        that activate the body’s innate healing mechanisms. Our treatment plans are tailored for long-term success—not short-term
        fixes.
