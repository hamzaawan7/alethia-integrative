      <p>
        Routine primary care checkups are one of the most powerful ways to preserve your health, prevent illness, and address
        symptoms at their root. At Aletheia Integrative in Lincoln, Nebraska, Jaime K. Dodge, MD, and our team of integrative and
        direct primary care providers go beyond the conventional model to deliver care that’s proactive, personalized, and deeply
        aligned with your body’s natural ability to heal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our approach combines the best of traditional medicine with functional medicine diagnostics, looking at the full picture of
        your health—including lab work, physical exams, lifestyle factors, and underlying imbalances. Whether you’re coming in for a
        checkup, chronic condition support, or preventive care, each visit is designed to uncover the “why” behind your symptoms—not
        just treat the surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also incorporate holistic methods where appropriate, including nutritional support, targeted supplementation, and therapies
        that activate the body’s innate healing mechanisms. Our treatment plans are tailored for long-term success—not short-term
        fixes.
      </p>

      <div className="mt-3 p-6" style={{ background: "#D2D8E9" }}>
        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-semibold text-[rgb(38,69,123)]">Is primary care necessary if I’m in good health?</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">Absolutely. Primary care is a foundational part of preventive, whole-body health.</p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Even if you're feeling well and full of energy, it doesn't always mean your body is functioning at its best. Many chronic
          conditions—like high blood pressure, insulin resistance, and inflammation—can develop silently, without noticeable
          symptoms.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          At Aletheia Integrative, we use primary care not only to treat illness or injury but to proactively identify imbalances
          before they become problems. Our team emphasizes early detection, functional lab testing, lifestyle education, and
          collaboration with specialists when needed. We’re here to help you stay ahead of disease and thrive at every stage of life.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-[24px] text-[rgb(199,90,51)] font-semibold mt-8">What Primary Care Services Does Aletheia Integrative Offer?</h2>
      <p>
        At Aletheia Integrative, primary care is more than just routine checkups — it’s a proactive partnership in your lifelong
        health. Our integrative model blends traditional medical care with the tools of functional medicine to uncover root causes,
        prevent disease, and help you thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also operate under a Direct Primary Care (DPC) model, which means our patients receive unparalleled access, more time with
        their provider, and a deeper level of personalized care—without the red tape of insurance.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-[18px] font-semibold text-[rgb(38,69,123)]">Employee Wellness Programs</h4>
      <p>
        We partner with local businesses to create customized employee wellness programs that support healthier teams and workplaces.
        Our offerings help reduce absenteeism, promote injury prevention, and encourage sustainable lifestyle changes that benefit
        both employers and employees.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-[18px] font-semibold text-[rgb(38,69,123)]">Comprehensive Physical Exams</h4>
      <p>
        Our physicals go beyond the basics. We take time to evaluate your whole-body health, checking vital signs, completing a
        thorough exam, and ordering relevant lab work. We also include sex-specific screenings and spend time understanding your
        history, goals, and any underlying symptoms—even those you might not notice.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-[18px] font-semibold text-[rgb(38,69,123)]">Preventive Screenings</h4>
      <p>
        We offer a range of preventive services designed to catch illness early—when it’s most treatable. These include Pap smears,
        prostate and breast exams, and thermography (a radiation-free imaging option for early inflammation detection). We also
        coordinate referrals for advanced imaging like colonoscopies and mammograms when needed.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-[18px] font-semibold text-[rgb(38,69,123)]">Functional Lab Testing</h4>
      <p>
        Our lab work includes both standard and advanced panels that evaluate things like hormone balance, inflammation, gut health,
        nutrient deficiencies, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risk. These insights allow us to build a personalized plan that
        supports long-term healing and prevention.
      </p>
